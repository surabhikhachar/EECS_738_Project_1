# EECS_738_Project_1

This is Andre Kurait and Surabhi Khachar's first project for EECS 738, Machine Learning. For the project one, we built a K-Means algorithm using Python and tested it on datasets from Kaggle.

The project requirements were the following:

1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Pick two datasets from
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/datasets
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
4. Formulate ideas on how machine learning can be used to
model distributions within the dataset
5. Build a heuristic and/or algorithm to model the data using
mixture models of probability distributions
programmatically
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other
supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

<h1>Data</h1>
The data chosen for this project was from the Iris dataset and Horse Colic dataset.

<h1>Feature Engineering:</h1>

<h1>K-Means Algorithm:</h1>
The algorithm we constructed is a basic algorithm to identify clusters given a certain set of features. It follows the discussion in this article: https://www.kaggle.com/andyxie/k-means-clustering-implementation-in-python
